# üöÄ Deployment Guide - Don't Drink!

## Quick Answer: How to Deploy

You have **3 options** for deployment, ranked from easiest to most control:

1. **Render** (Recommended) - Free, automatic, takes 5 minutes
2. **Railway** - Similar to Render, also free tier
3. **Your Own Server** - Full control, requires VPS

---

## üéØ Option 1: Deploy to Render (RECOMMENDED)

### Why Render?
- ‚úÖ Free tier available
- ‚úÖ Automatic deployments from GitHub
- ‚úÖ SSL certificate included
- ‚úÖ Easy to use
- ‚úÖ Good for Socket.IO apps

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### **1. Prepare Your Code for GitHub**

First, we need to push your code to GitHub:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /workspace

# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit - Don't Drink! party game"

# Create a new repository on GitHub:
# Go to https://github.com/new
# Repository name: dont-drink-game
# Make it Public or Private (your choice)
# DO NOT initialize with README (we already have one)
# Click "Create repository"

# Connect your local repo to GitHub (replace with YOUR username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/dont-drink-game.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

#### **2. Create Render Account**

1. Go to https://render.com
2. Click "Get Started" or "Sign Up"
3. **Sign up with GitHub** (easiest option)
4. Authorize Render to access your GitHub

#### **3. Create New Web Service**

1. Once logged in, click **"New +"** button (top right)
2. Select **"Web Service"**
3. Click **"Connect repository"** next to your `dont-drink-game` repo
   - If you don't see it, click "Configure account" to grant access
4. Fill in the details:

   ```
   Name: dont-drink-game (or any name you want)
   Region: Choose closest to you
   Branch: main
   Root Directory: (leave blank)
   Runtime: Node
   Build Command: npm install
   Start Command: npm start
   ```

5. Select **Free** plan (or paid if you want better performance)
6. Click **"Create Web Service"**

#### **4. Wait for Deployment**

- Render will now build and deploy your app
- This takes 2-5 minutes
- You'll see logs in real-time
- Look for: `‚úÖ Questions database loaded` and `DON'T DRINK! SERVER RUNNING`

#### **5. Your App is Live! üéâ**

Once deployed, you'll get a URL like:
```
https://dont-drink-game-abcd.onrender.com
```

**That's it!** Your game is now live on the internet.

### Testing Your Deployed App

1. **Open the URL** in your browser
2. **Host a game** at `https://your-app.onrender.com/host`
3. **Join on mobile** by scanning QR or going to the room code URL
4. **Play!**

### Important Notes for Render

‚ö†Ô∏è **Free Tier Limitations:**
- App "sleeps" after 15 minutes of inactivity
- First request after sleep takes ~30 seconds to wake up
- Solution: Just wait patiently on the loading screen
- Or upgrade to paid plan ($7/month) for always-on

‚úÖ **Benefits:**
- Automatic deployments when you push to GitHub
- Free SSL certificate (https://)
- Good performance for Socket.IO
- Easy to manage

## üéØ Option 2: Deploy to Railway

### Why Railway?
- ‚úÖ Also free tier
- ‚úÖ Similar to Render
- ‚úÖ Good performance
- ‚úÖ Nice dashboard

### Step-by-Step

1. **Push to GitHub** (same as Render above)

2. **Create Railway Account**
   - Go to https://railway.app
   - Sign up with GitHub

3. **Create New Project**
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose your `dont-drink-game` repo
   - Railway auto-detects Node.js

4. **Configure (if needed)**
   - Railway usually auto-configures everything
   - It reads your `package.json` start script

5. **Get Your URL**
   - Click "Settings" tab
   - Under "Domains", click "Generate Domain"
   - You'll get something like: `https://dont-drink-game-production.up.railway.app`

6. **Done!** Your app is live.

## üéØ Option 3: Your Own Server (VPS)

### Requirements
- A VPS (Digital Ocean, Linode, AWS EC2, etc.)
- SSH access
- Node.js installed on server

### Step-by-Step

#### **1. Get a VPS**
Choose one:
- **DigitalOcean** - $4/month droplet
- **Linode** - $5/month
- **AWS EC2** - Free tier available
- **Hetzner** - Cheap European servers

#### **2. SSH into Your Server**
```bash
ssh root@your-server-ip
```

#### **3. Install Node.js**
```bash
# Update system
apt update && apt upgrade -y

# Install Node.js (using NodeSource)
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | bash -
apt install -y nodejs

# Verify
node --version  # Should show v18.x or higher
npm --version
```

#### **4. Install PM2 (Process Manager)**
```bash
npm install -g pm2
```

#### **5. Clone Your Code**
```bash
# Install git if needed
apt install -y git

# Clone your repo
cd /var/www
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/dont-drink-game.git
cd dont-drink-game

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

#### **6. Start with PM2**
```bash
pm2 start server.js --name dont-drink
pm2 startup  # Makes it auto-start on reboot
pm2 save
```

#### **7. Set Up Nginx (Reverse Proxy)**
```bash
# Install Nginx
apt install -y nginx

# Create config
nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/dont-drink
```

Paste this config:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;  # Or use server IP

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        
        # Important for Socket.IO
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

```bash
# Enable site
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/dont-drink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
nginx -t  # Test config
systemctl restart nginx
```

#### **8. (Optional) Add SSL with Let's Encrypt**
```bash
apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx
certbot --nginx -d your-domain.com
```

#### **9. Done!**
Visit `http://your-domain.com` or `http://your-server-ip`

## üì± Testing After Deployment

### 1. **Open Your Live URL**
```
https://your-app.onrender.com
```

### 2. **Create a Room as Host**
- Click "Host a Game"
- Note the room code (e.g., "ABC123")

### 3. **Join on Mobile**
Open your phone and go to:
```
https://your-app.onrender.com/ABC123
```

### 4. **Start Playing!**
- Select game, mode, intensity
- Click "Start Game"
- Enjoy your deployed party game!

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot connect to server"

**Solution for Render/Railway:**
```javascript
// In mobile.html, the code should detect the correct URL:
const socketUrl = window.location.origin;  // This is correct
```
This is already implemented in your code!

### Issue: "App is slow to load"

**Render Free Tier:**
- First load after sleep takes 30 seconds
- Just wait patiently
- Subsequent loads are instant

**Solution:** Upgrade to paid plan or use Railway

### Issue: "Socket.IO won't connect"

**Check:**
1. Server is running (check Render logs)
2. No browser console errors
3. Firewall not blocking WebSocket

**Fix:** The code already handles this with fallback to polling

### Issue: "QR code doesn't work"

**Make sure:**
- Using the deployed URL (not localhost)
- QR code library loaded (already in code)
- Mobile has internet connection

---

## üîß Environment Variables (Optional)

If you want to customize, you can add these in Render/Railway dashboard:

```bash
PORT=3000           # Usually auto-set by platform
NODE_ENV=production # Good practice
```

Your app works without any env variables though!

## üí∞ Cost Comparison

| Platform | Free Tier | Paid Tier | Best For |
|----------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Render** | ‚úÖ Yes, 750hrs/mo | $7/mo always-on | Easy deployment |
| **Railway** | ‚úÖ Yes, $5 credit/mo | $5/mo | Similar to Render |
| **DigitalOcean** | ‚ùå No | $4/mo | Full control |
