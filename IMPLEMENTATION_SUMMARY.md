## 🎯 Core Game Mechanics Implemented

### **Game × Mode Matrix (All 16 Combinations)**

| Game | Offline | Mobile Voting | Spotlight | Mixmaster |
|------|---------|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| **NHIE** | ✅ Display-only | ✅ I HAVE/NEVER voting | ✅ Private + reveal | ✅ Rotates |
| **FMK** | ✅ Display-only | ✅ Simplified voting | ✅ Private + reveal | ✅ Rotates |
| **WYR** | ✅ Display-only | ✅ A/B voting | ✅ Private + reveal | ✅ Rotates |
| **Hot Takes** | ✅ Display-only | ✅ Agree/Disagree voting | ✅ Private + reveal | ✅ Rotates |

### **Spotlight Mode - Critical Feature**
✅ **EVERYONE SEES WHO, BUT NOT WHAT UNTIL REVEAL:**

2. Server sends `spotlight-active` event with player name + avatar
3. **All screens show WHO is in spotlight** (with emoji + name)
4. Spotlight player selects answer privately
5. Other players see "Thinking..." status
6. When ready, spotlight player hits "REVEAL ANSWER"
7. **NOW everyone sees the answer** on all screens
8. Spotlight rotates to next player
