**Commit:** aa512b4 - Fix critical bugs: offline mode, mobile redirect, and question loading

---

## ✅ All Tests PASSED

### Test 1: HTML Files Validity
```
✅ public/host.html - OK
✅ public/mobile.html - OK
✅ public/play.html - OK
```

### Test 2: Questions Database
```
✅ never_have_i_ever / medium -> "Never have I ever eaten candy for breakfast..."
✅ fmk / spicy -> "Someone who's terrible in bed, Someone who's amazing..."
✅ would_you_rather / cancelled -> Question object with optionA and optionB
✅ hot_takes / medium -> "Gap years should be mandatory..."
```

**Result:** All 4 game types load questions correctly from database

---

### Test 3: Offline Mode Start Button Logic

| Scenario | Players | Expected | Result |
|----------|---------|----------|--------|
| Offline mode, no players | 0 | ENABLED | ✅ ENABLED |
| Voting mode, no players | 0 | DISABLED | ✅ DISABLED |
| Voting mode, with players | 2 | ENABLED | ✅ ENABLED |
| No game selected | 0 | DISABLED | ✅ DISABLED |

**Result:** Offline mode can now start without players! ✅

---

### Test 4: URL Parameter Passing

**Before (WRONG):**
```
/play?room=ABC123&game=nhie
```
Missing mode and intensity = questions won't load!

**After (CORRECT):**
```
/play?room=ABC123&game=nhie&mode=offline&intensity=medium
```
All parameters passed = questions load perfectly! ✅
